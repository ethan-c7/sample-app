This code is a quick example of a web application that integrates our [Copilot API](https://www.nabla.com/). 

To test it on your machine:
- First you need an API key. To get one, please [contact us](mailto:contact@nabla.com?subject=I%20need%20a%20Nabla%20Copilot%20API%20key)
- Replace the placeholder in `main.js` line 1 with your key. 
- Then, you just need to run a http static server.  

For instance, if Node.js is installed on your machine, you can run:
```shell
npx http-server .
```
and browse http://127.0.0.1:8080/

You'll find more information about Nabla APIs on our [documentation](https://docs.nabla.com/reference/copilot-listen)
